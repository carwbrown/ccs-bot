# ccs-bot

discord bot for the ccs channel

## Purpose

A discord bot for the CCS discord channel. Original functionality is to create a command to delete all messages in a given channel. Currently, stakeholders are going to several channels and deleting each message individually every day.

## TODO

- rip off ideas from here https://github.com/Asddsa76/Probius
- auto add tournament captain flag with a command
- move all the ccs info commands
- open house bot?
